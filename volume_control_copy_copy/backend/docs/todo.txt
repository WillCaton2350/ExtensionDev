Try:
    Converting the python VC logiv perfectly over to opencv.js
    - I might need node js to connect the opencv.js script to my computers OS in order to change the volume on the computer / laptop    

The application is divided into a few parts.
These parts contain the Backend directory which holds the root.py file. 
This root.py file holds the logic for the computer vision volume control program.
The root.py file is pointed or directed to the middleware directory which holds the main.py file.
This main.py file holds a subprocess action that createes a separate thread and activates the main.py file from the backend.
This main.py file is the first layer in the middleware.
Now we have a script.js javascript file that is the first layer of the middleware.
The second layer in the middleware is the script.js file. This JS file should trigger the python logic. 
Once the javascript file / function is conncected we connect it to html flie with a script element with a source attribute.
The Html file is also connected to the css file which adds styling to the user interface of the extension.
Now we have the index.html and script.js file that is completed. We connect it to the manifest.json file in extension directory through the default_popup variable.
The manifest.json file holds the requirements for the boiler plate / default / unpacked google chrome extension. 
The icon.png file needs to be resized / scaled down to 48px x 48px before deployment
So the directory order looks like this:

<extension>
游리    - manifest.json

<frontend>
游리    - index.html 
游릭    - styles.css

<middlewares>
游댮    - script.js
游릭    - main.py 

<backend>
游릭    - root.py
